  \class PhysicalLayer

  \brief Provides common interface for protocols that run on %LoRa/FSK modules, such as RTTY or LoRaWAN. Also extracts some common
  module-independent methods. Using this interface class allows to use the protocols on various modules without much code duplicity.
  Because this class is used mainly as interface, all of its virtual members must be implemented in the module class.
